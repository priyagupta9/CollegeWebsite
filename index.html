		<p class="greet">Greetings from Ramanujan College,</p>
    <p>It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Ramanujan College. In the past ten years, since the institution became a full-fledged morning college, we have grown rapidly into one of the best institution of the University of Delhi. Infrastructural expansion in terms of a state of the art new building, additional computer labs , media lab and additional class rooms in well provided porta cabins is complimented by the introduction of new honours courses, vocational courses and many profession specific add on courses.  Our enthusiastic and highly competent teaching faculty is totally focussed on academic excellence both inside the class room as well as in the field of research.  A large number of resource persons, the best in the field, are invited to the college regularly for lectures and workshops.  The student’s interest in extracurricular activities, may it be in music, dance, theatre, film making, art and craft, environment and ecology, debating, fashion and sports are taken care by the many societies and cells of the college.  We actively encourage students and teachers to initiate programmes and events that help them to realise their creative longings and inner calling.  An efficient administrative staff supports all endeavours in the college.  The College has been involved in a large number of outreach programmes in its mission to reach out to the unreached and the under privileged in our society.</p>
